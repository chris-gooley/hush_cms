Hush CMS
=======

A content management extension for Rails, unobtrusively adding static (page) and dynamic (post) content retrieval and management.


Requirements
=======

tiny_mce (check out http://github.com/kete/tiny_mce)


Example
=======

* Install Hush CMS and TinyMCE

  script/plugin install git://github.com/JamesBrooks/hush_cms.git
  script/plugin install git://github.com/kete/tiny_mce.git


* Perform TinyMCE post-installation scripts installation

  rake tiny_mce:scripts:install


* Follow the instructions and edit config/hush.yml, as well as ensuring haml is installed


* Generate migrations for CMS models (and migrate)

  script/generate hush_cms migrations
  rake db:migrate


* Add a route for CMS pages and admin in config/routes.rb, e.g.

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    map.hush_cms_pages 'pages/*path'
    map.hush_cms_admin 'admin/cms'

    ...
  end

  
* Done! (More documentation to come once page administration is complete, as well as posts/categories and comments).
