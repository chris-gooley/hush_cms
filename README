Hush CMS
=======

A content management extension for Rails, unobtrusively adding static (page) and dynamic (post) content retrieval and management.


Example
=======

* Install Hush CMS

  script/plugin install git://github.com/JamesBrooks/hush_cms.git

* Generate migrations for CMS models (and migrate)

  script/generate hush_cms migrations
  rake db:migrate

* Add a route for CMS pages in config/routes.rb, e.g.

  ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    map.hush_cms_pages 'pages/*path'

    ...
  end
  
* Done! (More documentation to come once page administration is complete, as well as posts/categories and comments).
